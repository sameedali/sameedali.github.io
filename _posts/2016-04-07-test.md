Having it learned the hard way, that a laptop's HDD is **not** a perfectly safe location for my data - and that it is as prone to data loss as any other, *especially* one that has its OS reinstalled every 5 months, I have set up this website/blog, in want of a place to safely archive things of my interest.

This, I believe, will be the perfect abode for my intellectual musings, development related shenanigans and the oh-would-you-look-at-that intricacies while I code my life away into oblivion.

Bleh.

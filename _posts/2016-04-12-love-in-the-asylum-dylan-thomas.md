> Love in the Asylum
>
> A stranger has come
>
> To share my room in the house not right in the head,
>
> A girl mad as birds
>
> Bolting the night of the door with her arm her plume.
>
> Strait in the mazed bed
>
> She deludes the heaven-proof house with entering clouds
>
>
> Yet she deludes with walking the nightmarish room,
>
> At large as the dead,
>
> Or rides the imagined oceans of the male wards.
>
> She has come possessed
>
> Who admits the delusive light through the bouncing wall,
>
> Possessed by the skies
>
>
> She sleeps in the narrow trough yet she walks the dust
>
> Yet raves at her will
>
> On the madhouse boards worn thin by my walking tears.
>
>
> And taken by light in her arms at long and dear last
>
> I may without fail
>
> Suffer the first vision that set fire to the stars.
>

>                                             ~ Dylan Thomas

I just came across this poem.

What a beautiful way to portray the dreaded conflict between happiness and melancholy!

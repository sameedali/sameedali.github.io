It was a pleasant surprise to discover him.

Al Ma'arri - the skeptic, the philosopher, the poet whose songs now remain buried in the tomes of history.

I had the privilege of reading The Luzumiyat of Al-Ma'arri.

It is remarkable how the message conveyed by his verses remains relevant to this day.

I had the opportunity to acquaint myself with a few medieval Arab works, recently.

And among those Al-Maarri's work particularly caught my attention because of its radical leftist ideas, and his blatant denial of the revelations.

I was amazed to find the existence of such a skeptic in the medieval Islamic period.

Upon researching a little, I realised that quite a few of these individuals existed during those periods.

I have found an interest in reading the works of these 'zindiq's.

Some of the notable ones I found are:

- Abu Nuwas

- Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi

- Ibn al-Khatib

- Ibn al-Muqaffa

- Abu Shakir

- Abu Tammar Muttabib

- Abu Isa al-Warraq

- Ibn al-Rawandi

- Al-Maʿarri

- Yazdan ibn Badhan

- Bashar ibn Burd

- Abu 'All Raja' ibn Yazdanbakht, a Manichaean theologian during the caliphate of al-Ma'mun (813-833 CE)

- Abdulkarim ibn abi Al-Ouja

- Khalid al-Qasri

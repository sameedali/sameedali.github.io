“the dpc has its own ideology, they are holding their programme on oct 28. we cannot stop them but we did not invite them. we did not invite dpc or shuhada counil.” - (pti) [http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2016/10/25/national/pti-did-not-invite-dpc-banned-outfits-for-islamabad-lockdown-says-shah-mehmood/]

of course, pti cannot stop them but what it can do is try to distance itself from these fanatics.

but it does not.

and that is, or rather should be, very troubling for all residents of this country.

is it too much to ask from pti to refuse to allow these terrorist/terrorist symphatizing outfits to protest along side them?

ik's (manifest symphathy)[http://nation.com.pk/national/24-oct-2016/lal-masjid-hints-at-support-for-pti-s-islamabad-lockdown] towards extremists makes me cast serious doubts on his intentions to battle terrorism.

a sympathy towards terrorists clearly is the **last** thing pakistan needs in her prime minister to win the war on terror.
